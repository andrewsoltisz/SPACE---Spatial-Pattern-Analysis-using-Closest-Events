# SPACE---Spatial-Pattern-Analysis-using-Closest-Events

## Content: 
SPACE - Statistically characterize the spatial relationship between 2 image components using point pattern analysis. 
Isotropic Replacement - Correct spatial anisotropy of images (different resolution in x/y/z) without altering signal sample size or morphology.
Synthetic Image Generation - Generate synthetic dual-channel masks whose spatial relatiosnhip can be tuned with a single input parameter.

Theory: This tool leverages bivariate nearest neighor distribution functions (G- and F-functions) from the point pattern analysis paradigm. The underlying theory is described in https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470057339.van007.
