Description:
Generate synthetic images of two image-based point patterns, X and Y, such that the mean distance between each Y-event and its closest X-event can be statistically modulated using a single input parameter, S. Given a user specified image size, desired event count for each pattern, and target Y-->X spatial proximity S within the range [-1,1], the X-pattern mask is first generated by assigning each X-event to its own unique and random pixel within the image, without replacement. Each Y-event is then assigned a distance-from-X using the inverse-CDF (cumulative distribution function) method and subsequently assigned, with replacement, to a random pixel within the image that satisfies its distance assignment. Here, each Y-event is assigned a random value within the range [-1,1] which is then used to interpolate the Y-->X distance value from the CDF derived from the PDF (probability density function) of all distances composing the distance transformation of Xâ€™s mask which represents the distribution of Y-->X distances expected under complete spatial randmoness (CSR). The mean Y-->X distance is tuned by using the spatial proximity parameter S as an input to a transfer function which subsequently biases the morphology of this assignment-PDF to select for smaller or larger distances. When S is 0, the assignment-PDF is unaltered and Y-events will be assigned distances expected under CSR. When S is negative, the assignment-PDF is transformed to increase the frequency of larger distances, thus Y-events will generally be assigned distances larger than expected under CSR. And when S is positive, the assignment-PDF is transformed to increase the frequency of smaller distances, thus Y-events will generally be assigned distances smaller than expected under CSR.
