## Description:  
Generate synthetic images of two image-based point patterns, X and Y, such that the mean distance between each Y-event and its closest X-event can be statistically modulated using a single input parameter, S (Fig. 1). Given a user specified image size, desired event count for each pattern, and target Y-->X spatial proximity S within the range [-1,1], the X-pattern mask is first generated by assigning each X-event to its own unique and random pixel within the image, without replacement. Each Y-event is then assigned a distance-from-X using the inverse-CDF method and subsequently assigned, with replacement, to a random pixel within the image that satisfies its distance assignment. Here, each Y-event is assigned a random value within the range [-1,1] which is then used to interpolate the Y-->X distance value from the CDF (Fig. 1D) derived from the PDF (Fig. 1C) of all distances composing the distance transformation of X’s mask which represents the distribution of Y-->X distances expected under the complete spatial randomness (CSR). The mean Y-->X distance is tuned by using the spatial proximity parameter S as an input to a transfer function which subsequently biases the morphology of this assignment-PDF to select for smaller or larger distances (Fig. 1A). When S is 0, the assignment-PDF is unaltered and Y-events will be assigned distances expected under CSR (Fig. 1B-E middle). When S is negative, the assignment-PDF is transformed to increase the frequency of larger distances, thus Y-events will generally be assigned distances larger than expected under CSR (ig. 1B-E top). And when S is positive, the assignment-PDF is transformed to increase the frequency of smaller distances, thus Y-events will generally be assigned distances smaller than expected under CSR (Fig. 1B-E bottom).

Figure 1. (A) Empirical function, defined by x-coordinates linearly spaced between 0 and 1 and y-coordinates logarithmically spaced between 0.026 and 4, to convert the input YX spatial proximity parameter S into a standard deviation σ value for the half normal distribution N(μ,σ) used for transforming the YX distance assignment-PDF. Blue dots indicate sample S and σ values used for generating (B) exemplar N(μ,σ) PDF transfer functions. (C) N(μ,σ)-transformed PDFs defining the distribution of distances between Y-events and their closest X-events. (D) The CDFs derived from the (C) PDFs used to assign each Y-event a distance-to-X using the inverse-CDF method. (E) Resulting synthetic images where the mean distance between Y-events (green) and X-events (red) have been tuned using the parameter S. (B middle) When S is 0, the N(μ,σ)-transfer function is equal to 1 at all distance, causing the assignment-PDF to be unaltered and Y-events to be assigned distances expected under CSR. (B top) When S is negative, the N(μ,σ)-transfer function is biased to favor larger distances, thus increasing their frequency in the assignment-PDF and causing Y-events to generally be assigned distances greater than expected under CSR. (B bottom) When S is positive, the N(μ,σ)-transfer function is biased to favor smaller distances, thus increasing their frequency in the assignment-PDF and causing Y-events to generally be assigned distances smaller than expected under CSR.
