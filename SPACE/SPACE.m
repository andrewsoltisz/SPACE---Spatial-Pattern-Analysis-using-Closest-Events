function [Results] = SPACE(mask_subject, mask_landmark, mask_ROI, pixelSize, alpha)
% Perform 'Spatial Pattern Analysis using Closest Events' (SPACE), a
% discrete, bivariate, nearest neighbor-based point patten analysis which
% characterizes the spatial association between two different patterns
% within a digital image. Analysis results describe the association of the
% first (subject) pattern's events relative to the second (landmark)
% pattern's events.
%
% 
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% INPUTS:
%
% 1. MASK_SUBJECT - Discrete events which compose an imaged pattern whose
%                   spatial distribution relative to the landmark pattern
%                   will be described by the analysis results. Formatted as
%                   a logical matrix (binary image mask) of any dimension
%                   with events represented by 'true' elements. The matrix
%                   size must match the sizes of MASK_LANDMARK and
%                   MASK_ROI.
%
% 2. MASK_LANDMARK - Discrete events which compose an imaged pattern that
%                    will serve as the landmark by which the subject
%                    pattern's spatial distribution will be derived.
%                    Formatted as a logical matrix (binary image mask) of
%                    any dimension with events represented by 'true'
%                    elements. The matrix size must match the sizes of
%                    MASK_SUBJECT and MASK_ROI.
%
% 3. MASK_ROI - OPTIONAL input which is a logical matrix (binary image
%               mask) of any dimension used to indicate a
%               region-of-interest (ROI) within the full study area where
%               the analysis will be exclusively performed. Event pixels
%               which fall outside of this region will contribute no
%               information to the analysis. If you do not want to specify
%               an ROI but do want to provide subsequent function inputs,
%               then provide this input as an empty matrix. If this input
%               is not provided or input as an empty matrix, then the
%               entire study area will be considered and all event pixels
%               will be used in the analysis. Here, the set of elements
%               with a value of 1 or 'true' represent the region(s) to
%               include in the analysis and the set of elements with a
%               value of 0 or 'false' represent the region(s) to omit from
%               the analysis. This matrix must have the same size as
%               MASK_SUBJECT and MASK_LANDMARK. This input is MANDATORY if
%               MASK_SUBJECT and MASK_LANDMARK were first processed using
%               the Isotropic Replacement method, otherwise this analyses
%               will produce 100% garbage results.
%
% 4. PIXELSIZE - OPTIONAL input which specifies the real-world size
%                (side-length) of pixels composing the digital image(s)
%                being analyzed. Formatted as a positive numeric scalar. If
%                you do not want to specify a pixel size but do want to
%                provide subsequent function inputs, then provide this
%                input as an empty matrix. If this input is not provided or
%                input as an empty matrix, then distance-derived outputs
%                will have units of 'pixel-count'. This input is used to
%                scale SPACE results so they have the same-real world units
%                as the input digital image(s). For the SPACE analysis to
%                produce results which are not 100% garbage, the real-world
%                shape of image pixels must be cuboidal, meaning every side
%                of the pixel has the same length, and this length is the
%                single value that needs to be assigned to this input
%                variable. If your pixels are in fact not cuboidal (e.g.
%                the x/y-resolution of your digital image is different than
%                its z-resolution), fear not! You just have to resample the
%                masks so that they are isotropic and have cuboidal pixels.
%                This can easily be done using the Isotropic Replacement
%                method found at the GitHub link below. From this method,
%                the 'isotropic_ROI mask' (2nd) output must then be used as
%                the MASK_ROI input to this function for the SPACE analysis
%                to be performed correctly.
%
% 5. ALPHA - OPTIONAL input which specifies the significance level for
%            testing complete spatial randomness of the subject pattern
%            relative to the landmark pattern. Formatted as a numeric
%            scalar with a value between 0 and 1, exlusive. A value of 0.05
%            is used by default if no value is provided.
%
%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%
% 1. RESULST - SPACE analysis results formatted as a 1-by-12 table which
%              describe the spatial distribution of the subject pattern's
%              events relative to the landmark pattern's events. See the
%              linked GitHub page below for info on what each table field
%              represents. If at least one of the patterns has no events,
%              then the analysis cannot be performed and most table fields
%              will automatically be assigned a value of 'NaN' to avoid
%              throwing errors and crashing batch analyses. NOTE: To fully
%              describe the spatial association between two different
%              patterns, this analyis must be performed twice, such that
%              each pattern has been treated as the subject and landmark
%              pattern.

%                  (representing distance) of the delta function which
%                  compares the observed and random CDFs. The x-coordinates
%                  are calculated as the set of all unique x-coordinates

%                  many elements as the output DELTA_CDF_Y and the
%                  elemenets will monotonically increase.
%
% 2. DELTA_CDF_Y - Numeric column vector listing the x-coordinates
%                  (representing probability) of the delta function which
%                  compares the observed and random CDFs. The y-coordinates
%                  are calculated as the random PDF y-coordinates
%                  subtracted from the observed PDF y-coordinates. This

%                  Each element will have a value between -1 and 1.
%
% 3. TESTSTATISTIC - Numeric scalar that summarizes the magnitude of
%                    deviation from complete spatial randomness. Calculated
%                    as the value from DELTA_CDF_Y with the largest

%             approximation from a 2-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
%             comparing the observed and random CDFs. This wil have a value
%             between 0 and 1. If this has a value less than ALPHA, then
%             there is sufficient evidence to reject the nullhypothesis
%             which states that the observed and random distributions are
%             them same.
%
% 5. VERDICT - Logical scalar indicating whether the null hypothesis from
%              the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was rejected. A value of 'true'
%              indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject the null
%              hypothesis and a value of 'false' indicates there is not
%              sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
